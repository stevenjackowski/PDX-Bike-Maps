A repository for creating some fun maps using shape files retrieved from the [Portland GIS Open Data Site](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/). Data preparation in Jupyter Notebooks using Pandas and Geopandas. In order to view visuals locally, you may need to run a simple HTTP web server to get around cross-origin request security features built into browsers (e.g. Chrome). Using Python 3, you can simply run:

`python -m http.server`
